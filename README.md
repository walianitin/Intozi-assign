I'll focus on the most crucial and challenging resources for RTSP streaming, ordered by importance and complexity:

1. Most Critical Protocol Documentation:
- RFC 2326 (RTSP Protocol): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2326
  * This is your foundation - it explains how RTSP actually works
  * Focus on sections 3 (Protocol Operation) and 10 (Basic Operation)
  * Most challenging but most important to understand

2. Core Library (PyAV):
- PyAV Documentation: https://pyav.org/docs/stable/
  * The most efficient library for RTSP in Python
  * Start with: https://pyav.org/docs/stable/overview/about.html
  * Critical for handling real-time streaming properly
  * Most developers struggle with its concepts initially

3. FFmpeg Documentation:
- https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html
  * Essential for creating and testing RTSP streams
  * Focus on the streaming protocols section
  * You'll need this for debugging and testing

4. Best Technical Guide for Implementation:
- Low Latency Streaming: https://www.wowza.com/blog/low-latency-streaming-basics
  * Practical implementation challenges
  * Real-world solutions for common problems
  * Explains why certain approaches work better than others

5. Must-Read for Performance:
- Network performance for real-time media: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/media/
  * Critical for understanding buffer management
  * Explains latency issues and solutions
  * Direct impact on your implementation quality

The Learning Sequence I Recommend:

1. First Week:
- Read RFC 2326 sections 3 and 10
- Practice with FFmpeg basic commands
- Set up PyAV and try basic examples

2. Second Week:
- Deep dive into PyAV documentation
- Implement basic streaming
- Study buffer management from Google's guide

3. Third Week:
- Focus on performance optimization
- Implement error handling
- Add multi-client support

Common Stumbling Points to Focus On:
1. Buffer management (most fail here)
2. Latency handling (second biggest challenge)
3. Client synchronization
4. Error recovery

Want me to explain any of these areas in more detail?
